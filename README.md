# DEPRECATED

OgE as a project is deprecated and will not be updated anymore.

For a more modern query runner for Pathom check https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom/issues/97

# Usage

The easiest way is to use the OgE Public version at https://wilkerlucio.github.io/oge/.

## Run locally

```
lein figwheel dev
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:3450/index-dev.html
```

## Demo
